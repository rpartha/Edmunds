# Programming Challenge

Given a CSV file, write a program that can parse and store Vehicle objects based off of the file. A Vehicle has a Year (Integer), Make (String), Model (String)  
and MSRP(BigDecimal). Then, generate a report that details each vehicle grouped by year and ordered by make. The report will display the vehicle's information  
along with its list price (the list price is the MSRP x Tax Rate). Save this report to the file system in the same directory as the CSV file.

Input (vehicles.csv, taxRate = 1.07)
